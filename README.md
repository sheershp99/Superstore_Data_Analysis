# Superstore Data Analysis
This data analysis project is based on the dataset of a superstore selling products across US. The dataset was obtained from ***Kaggle*** in ***.csv*** file. The dataset consists of **9994** sales records spanning over a period of 4 years. This project covers some key concepts of data analysis using Microsoft Excel like data cleaning, pivot table, data visualization, use of slicers & use of formulas in excel. 

Before diving into the analysis of the data, dataset was cleaned by checking for any duplicate records and blank cells, proper datatype was set for each column & appropriate changes were made to the datetime columns.

In this project, I have analysed and compared the performance across different regions in the US, sales in different cities, best performing sub-categories, orders per state, seasonality in orders & profit etc.

Beside the dataset worksheet in the **.xlsx** file, there is a worksheet called **Dashboard** which consists of all the charts & graphs for better visualization & understanding of data. The dashboard is connected to 5 slicers in order to apply the filter and see the change in the trend.

A report has also been attached to this project which summarises the key insights and also holds the conclusion of the analysis at the end. This report also holds few reccomendation at the end on how the store can improve performance in the regions & cities where the performance is not upto the mark and also how they can reward the valuable customers to maintain there customer base to a decent number of customers.
